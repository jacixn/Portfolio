                <div class="section-highlight">
                    <p>This consultancy role significantly enhanced my ability to translate complex technical security concepts into strategic business imperatives that resonate with executive leadership. The project demonstrated the critical importance of effective stakeholder communication in driving organisational change around security practices.</p>
                </div>
                <p>Working with the Executive Advisory Team provided invaluable experience in engaging with board-level decision-makers on cybersecurity matters. The innovative presentation approach we developed—combining role-playing scenarios with video elements demonstrating real-world security breaches—proved highly effective at maintaining executive engagement and driving meaningful action.</p>
                <p>Our team's final presentation to the client's board successfully transformed their perception of cybersecurity from a peripheral technical issue to a central business concern. Following our engagement, the client implemented all recommended security controls and established a dedicated security governance committee with board-level representation, demonstrating the significant impact of our strategic advisory work.</p>
                <p>The consultancy methodologies implemented during this project demonstrate my ability to:</p>
                <ul class="experience-list">
                    <li>Translate technical security concepts into business-relevant strategic imperatives</li>
                    <li>Engage effectively with executive stakeholders on complex security matters</li>
                    <li>Develop practical implementation roadmaps aligned with business objectives</li>
                    <li>Balance immediate security needs with long-term strategic goals</li>
                    <li>Drive organisational change through compelling communication strategies</li>
