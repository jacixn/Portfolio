                            <p>In this project, I set up a secure webserver on an Ubuntu environment using VirtualBox. The goal was to create a highly secure yet functional server that could withstand various cyber threats while hosting a real website. I implemented multiple layers of security, from SSL encryption and SSH hardening to intrusion detection and brute-force protection.</p>
                            <p>To demonstrate the practical application of this secure environment, I developed gojogym.com, a functional gym website with user authentication, booking capabilities, and database integrationâ€”all protected by the robust security measures implemented on the server.</p>

                            <p>This project involved a comprehensive approach to server security, starting with a controlled testing environment created using VirtualBox. I set up two virtual machines: an Ubuntu 20.04.1 Server to host the webserver and a Kali Linux machine for security testing.</p>
                            <p>The core security measures implemented included SSL encryption with a self-signed certificate, SSH hardening with disabled root login and key-based authentication, Two-Factor Authentication for admin access, and Fail2Ban to detect and block brute-force attacks.</p>

                            <p>Beyond the fundamental security measures, I enhanced the server's defenses with ModSecurity, a powerful Web Application Firewall that protected against common web exploits like SQL injection attacks. I also deployed Snort as an intrusion detection system to monitor and alert on suspicious network traffic.</p>
                            <p>For long-term security maintenance, I configured unattended updates to automatically apply security patches and implemented hotlink protection to prevent unauthorized access to website assets. These layered defenses created a robust security posture for the server.</p>

                            <p>A critical component of the server's security was the hardening of SSH access. I configured OpenSSH with multiple protective measures to prevent unauthorized access. This included disabling root login entirely, enforcing key-based authentication instead of passwords, changing the default SSH port, and implementing connection rate limiting.</p>
                            <p>Additionally, I integrated Google Authenticator to provide Two-Factor Authentication for SSH logins, adding an essential extra layer of security. This combination of measures made brute force attacks virtually impossible and significantly enhanced the server's access security.</p>

                            <p>To protect against application-level attacks, I implemented ModSecurity as a Web Application Firewall (WAF) for the Apache server. This powerful tool inspected HTTP requests and responses to identify and block malicious traffic targeting the web application.</p>
                            <p>I configured ModSecurity with the OWASP Core Rule Set to provide baseline protection against common web application attacks like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and local file inclusion. I then fine-tuned the rules to minimize false positives while maintaining robust protection. This was essential for securing the website's user interactions and database operations.</p>

                            <p>As part of this project, I developed a fully functional gym website, gojogym.com, to demonstrate the practical application of the secure webserver. Built using PHP and integrated with a MySQL database via phpMyAdmin, the site allowed users to securely book training sessions and access gym information.</p>
                            <p>The website featured user authentication with separate dashboards for clients and trainers, a booking system for training sessions, content management for gym information, and a secure registration system for new users.

                            <p>Securing the MySQL database was crucial for protecting user data on the gym website. I implemented multiple layers of database security, starting with strong password policies and restricted remote access permissions.</p>
                            <p>All database connections were made through secure channels, and I employed prepared statements and parameterized queries throughout the PHP code to prevent SQL injection attacks. User passwords were stored using strong hashing algorithms with unique salts, and database backups were regularly scheduled and encrypted to ensure data integrity and availability.</p>

                            <p>To ensure the effectiveness of the security measures, I conducted extensive testing targeting each component. I performed simulated brute-force attacks to verify that Fail2Ban correctly blocked IPs after multiple failed attempts. Vulnerability scans with Nmap showed no exploitable weaknesses, and Snort successfully detected and logged test intrusions.</p>
                            <p>I also tested website functionality to confirm that user authentication, booking systems, and data storage worked correctly while maintaining security. This comprehensive validation process verified that the server was both secure and practical for real-world use.</p>

Snort analyzed network packets in real-time, comparing them against a database of known attack signatures to identify malicious activity.</p>
                            <p>After configuring Snort with the correct network interface (which required troubleshooting, as detailed in the challenges section), I set up custom rules to detect specific threats relevant to web servers. I also implemented logging and alerting mechanisms to notify of potential intrusions, providing a critical layer of visibility into network security events.</p>

                            <p>One of the key challenges in implementing comprehensive security was maintaining acceptable server performance. Security measures like SSL encryption, packet inspection, and real-time monitoring all consume system resources, potentially impacting website responsiveness.</p>
                            <p>I addressed this challenge by fine-tuning each security component, optimizing Apache and MySQL configurations, and implementing caching strategies. This balanced approach allowed the server to maintain strong security while delivering responsive performance for the website users, demonstrating that security and usability can work hand-in-hand.</p>

                            <p>The most technically challenging aspect of this project was creating a cohesive security system where multiple defense mechanisms worked together without conflicts. For example, configuring ModSecurity rules to work alongside Fail2Ban's detection system required careful tuning to prevent unintended interactions.</p>
                            <p>I'm particularly proud of the SSL/TLS implementation, which achieved an A+ rating on SSL testing tools by implementing perfect forward secrecy, strong ciphers, and proper HSTS headers. These technical details demonstrate not just functional security, but security implemented according to industry best practices.</p>
